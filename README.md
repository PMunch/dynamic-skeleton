Dynamic Skeleton (working title, subject to change)
===================================================

Dynamic Skeleton is based on the Skeleton CSS framework. It takes all the
options you are most likely to change and pulls them out into a file of CSS
variables. This way you can keep the main file static while only changing your
variables when using the basic style in different projects. It also uses the
`calc` property liberally which means that if you change one variable all the
related things should change as well. It also adds a couple more utility
classes and a navbar, so the main site now only requires 30 lines of CSS to
show the examples while everything else is pure Dynamic Skeleton.
